# ATP Interacting Residues

Given a protein sequence, task is to identify which residues in the sequence are ATP interacting.\

Input format\
Input is in the form of 2 columns ID and Lable. For each id , we have a label which denotes a residue in given protein sequence. If it is in capital, it is ATP-interacting and if it is in small it is non interacting.\
\
Output format
Output file contains 2 columns, one is ID and the other is Lable. For each ID, Lable =1 denotes that the residue of given id is ATP interacting and if Lable = -1, it is non interacting.\
