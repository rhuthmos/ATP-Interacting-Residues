# ATP Interacting Residues

Given a protein sequence, task is to identify which residues in the sequence are ATP interacting.\\

Input format\\
Input is in the form of 2 columns ID and Lable. For each id , we have a label which denotes a residue in given protein sequence. If it is in capital, it is ATP-interacting and if it is in small it is non interacting.
